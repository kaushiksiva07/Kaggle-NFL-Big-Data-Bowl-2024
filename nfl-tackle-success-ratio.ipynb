However, relying solely on box-score metrics to evaluate tackling prowess presents a set of challenges:\n1. **Volume Bias**: Tackling stats are often volume-based, favoring players who are consistently on the field. This creates a bias where frequent participation can inflate tackling numbers.\n2. **Positional Disparity**: Certain positions, such as Inside Linebackers (ILB), tend to accrue higher tackle counts due to their positioning. This disparity skews the perceived tackling abilities of players in less favored positions, such as Defensive Ends (DE).\n3. **Situational Differences**: Box-score metrics offer no insights into the difficulty or context of each tackle, failing to differentiate between routine and exceptional tackles.\n\nIn this project, we aim to address the limitations associated with evaluating tackling prowess in the NFL. We're leveraging a predictive model that factors in various contextual elements to estimate the likelihood of successfully completing a tackle against a pass catcher. By incorporating these contextual factors, our goal is to refine the assessment of defensive capabilities and provide a more comprehensive understanding of player performance in tackling scenarios.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# **<center><span style=\"color:RebeccaPurple;\">Player Tackle Analysis</span></center>**\n***","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"fig, axes = plt.subplots(nrows=1, ncols=3, figsize=(19, 6))\n\n# Top 20 Players by Number of Tackles by position\npos_count = tackle_final.groupby('position')['nflId'].count()\nbars1 = pos_count.sort_values().plot(kind='barh', color='#6A0DAD', ax=axes[0])\nbars1.set_title('Number of Players by Position')\nbars1.set_xlabel('Number of Players')\nbars1.set_ylabel('Position')\nfor index, value in enumerate(pos_count.sort_values()):\n    bars1.text(value, index, str(value), ha='left', va='center', color='black', fontsize=7)\n\n# Top 20 Players by Number of Tackles by position\ntop_positions = tackle_final.groupby('position')['success_sum'].sum()\nbars2 = top_positions.sort_values().plot(kind='barh', color='#6A0DAD', ax=axes[1])\nbars2.set_title('Number of Tackles by Position')\nbars2.set_xlabel('Number of Tackles')\nbars2.set_ylabel('Position')\nfor index, value in enumerate(top_positions.sort_values()):\n    bars2.text(value, index, str(value), ha='left', va='center', color='black', fontsize=6)\n\n# Average Number of tackles by Position\nadj_pos = top_positions / pos_count\nbars3 = adj_pos.sort_values().plot(kind='barh', color='#6A0DAD', ax=axes[2])\nbars3.set_title('Average Number of Tackles by Position')\nbars3.set_xlabel('Number of Tackles')\nbars3.set_ylabel('Position')\nfor index, value in enumerate(adj_pos.sort_values()):\n    bars3.text(value, index, str(round(value, 2)), ha='left', va='center', color='black', fontsize=6)\n\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-12-30T20:15:36.093208Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-12-30T20:15:36.093575Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-12-30T20:15:37.051303Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-12-30T20:15:36.093543Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-12-30T20:15:37.050238Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The plots above demonstrate intriguing insights into the distribution of tackles across different positions. Cornerbacks (CB) emerge with the most significant number of players, followed by the second-highest total tackles, subsequently leading to the third-highest tackles-per-player ratio. Contrastingly, Inside Linebackers (ILB), possess the fewest players while displaying the highest tackle rate per player. These visuals underscore a compelling observation: positions with a higher count of players tend to accumulate more tackles owing to increased opportunities, influencing the overall tackle statistics. Moreover, the data highlights notable trends in positions like Inside Linebackers (ILB), Safeties (S), and Cornerbacks (CB), showcasing their higher tackle rates. This aligns with the understanding that specific positions often find themselves in situations conducive to potential tackles, thus encountering more opportunities for tackling and consequently recording a higher count of completed tackles. Such insights reveal how a player's position on the field directly correlates with their likelihood of engaging in tackling scenarios. Ultimately, these statistics neglect the contextual nuances of tackles, such as the ball carrier's position in open space relative to the defenders or the presence of blockers hindering the tackle attempts.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# **<center><span style=\"color:RebeccaPurple;\">Feature Engineering</span></center>**\n***","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"To enhance the understanding of factors influencing successful tackles, several key features were engineered:\n1. `blockers`: A binary indicator (1 for presence, 0 for absence) denoting the presence of blockers. Expectantly, the probability of a successful tackle decreases in the presence of blockers as they impede a defender's ability to tackle.\n2. `tack_side`: A binary indicator (1 for in front, 0 for behind) signifying the positioning of the defender concerning the pass catcher. Tackling from the front is intuitively perceived as easier than tackling from behind.\n3. `pos_diff`: A continuous positive value representing the Euclidean distance between the pass catcher and the defender. A shorter distance indicates higher odds of completing a tackle.\n4. `speed_diff`: A continuous value indicating the difference in speed between the pass catcher and the defender. A faster defender relative to the pass catcher may increase the likelihood of completing a tackle due to catching up.\n5. `rel_angle`: A continuous value reflecting the relative angle between the pass catcher and the defender. Favorable angles, where both face each other, might increase the tackle probability compared to opposing directions.\n6. `car_sideline`: A continuous value indicating the pass catcher's distance from the nearest sideline. Tackling near a sideline might facilitate easier tackles compared to tackles in the middle of the field.\n7. `weight_dif`: A continuous value expressing the weight difference between the pass catcher and the defender. If the defender is heavier for example, it might be harder for the pass catcher to break a tackle, leading to a higher probability of completing a tackle.\n8. `total_inches_tack`:  A continuous value representing the height of the defender.

Consequently, we focused on precision and recall, aiming to minimize false positives and false negatives, respectively.

The ROC curve (top-left) visually represents the trade-off between true positive rate and false positive rate across different threshold values. A curve closer to the upper-left corner of the plot indicates better performance, indicating higher True Positive Rate (TPR) while maintaining lower False Positive Rate (FPR). Additionally, the area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC) quantifies the model's performance; a higher AUC value (closer to 1) suggests better discrimination between positive and negative classes. In essence, the ROC curve helps in assessing the model's ability to distinguish between classes across varying thresholds, aiding in selecting the optimal threshold for your specific use case. Our model has an AUC-RUC of 0.93, which suggests that the model has strong predictive power, as it can separate the classes well. It implies that there's a 93% chance that the model will be able to distinguish between successful and unsuccessful tackles.\n\n2. The precision-recall curve (top-right) evaluates a model's performance by showing how well it balances precision (the ability to avoid false positives) and recall (the ability to find all positive instances) at different thresholds. Here, an AUC of 0.7 indicates that the model performs reasonably well but might have some limitations in its precision-recall trade-off. It suggests that the model is moderately successful in identifying relevant instances (recall) while maintaining a decent level of precision.\n\n3. The feature importance plot (bottom-left) gives us insight into how impactful each feature that we included is on the model's prediction. A higher importance would indicate a more substantial impact on the model's predictions. Here, we see that the distance between the pass catcher and the defender of interest is the most important feature. This is in line with our expectations as this is typically the most obvious indicator when determining whether a defender can make a tackle. \n\n4. The learning curve plot (bottom-right) helps us better understand the model's performance concerning the dataset size. As we can see, we see a narrowing in the gab between the training and cross-validation curves.

However, when evaluating their tackle success ratio, a more nuanced view emerges. Consider Inside Linebackers (ILB), where the range among players is only 5 tackles. Yet, analyzing their success ratios reveals disparities: Raashan Evans and Roquan Smith underperform compared to C.J. Mosley, who demonstrates an overperformance trend. This paints a much different picture than simple box scores which make these players appear to perform similarly. The most notable differences emerge among Defensive Ends (DE). Derrick Brown notably exceeds expectations, completing over twice the expected tackles, while Cameron Jordan falls significantly short, accomplishing less than half of the expected tackles. In summary, our model serves as a metric for comparing player performance, offering detailed insights that uncover substantial variations in tackling abilities, unrepresented by conventional box score metrics.","metadata":{}}]}
